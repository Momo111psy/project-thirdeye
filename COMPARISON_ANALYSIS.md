## The Verdict

### 🏆 **WINNER: Hybrid Approach**

Neither version is perfect alone. The optimal solution is:

**Use Standalone LLM for Speed + Manus Skill for Depth**

### Recommended Strategy:

1. **For Quick Roasts** (demos, social media, rapid feedback):
   - Use **Standalone LLM** (Gemini/Claude)
   - 30 seconds, good enough quality
   - Shareable to anyone

2. **For Deep Roasts** (portfolio, challenge submission, high-stakes):
   - Use **Manus Skill** with transcript search
   - Real citations, deeper expertise
   - Higher credibility

3. **For Scale** (public API, community tool):
   - **Hybrid**: LLM generates draft → Manus enriches with real citations
   - Best of both worlds
