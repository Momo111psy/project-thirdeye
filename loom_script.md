## Script

### 0:00-0:15 — Intro Screen
**[Show title slide or GitHub README]**

> "This is Thirdeye: The PM Devil's Advocate.  
> No polite AI. No cheerleading bad ideas.  
> Just brutal, citation-backed truth before you ship."

---

### 0:15-0:45 — Demo #1: Gamified Productivity App
**[Switch to Manus interface]**

> "Let me show you what this looks like.  
> Here's a classic bad idea: 'Build an AI-powered gamified productivity app with social features — think Duolingo meets Strava meets TikTok dopamine loops for habits.'"

**[Paste the idea, invoke Thirdeye skill]**

> "Watch what happens..."

**[Scroll through roast output, highlighting key sections]**

> "Verdict: Kill. Hard kill.  
> The Trap: Solution-in-search-of-a-problem + feature stacking fallacy.  
> Pre-Mortem: Month-by-month breakdown of exactly how this dies.  
> Expert Evidence: Real quotes from Teresa Torres, Marty Cagan, Shreyas Doshi — pulled straight from Lenny's podcast transcripts."

**[Pause on citations section]**

> "See these citations? That's Teresa Torres on jumping to solutions without discovery. Marty Cagan on feature factory thinking. Shreyas Doshi on placebo productivity.  
> This isn't generic AI advice — it's grounded in the exact mental models Lenny's audience worships."

---

### 0:45-1:15 — Demo #2: AI Meeting Assistant (Quick Version)
**[Optional: Show second roast or just mention it]**

> "Here's another one: AI meeting assistant that auto-generates action items, does sentiment analysis, integrates with Slack — basically Otter plus Fireflies plus Reclaim, but 'enterprise-grade.'"

**[Show verdict if time, or just say:]**

> "Thirdeye's verdict? Kill. You're treating symptoms, not root causes. You're in a crowded market with no moat. And 'enterprise-grade privacy' is just theater.  
> Same format. Same pain. Same citations."

---

### 1:15-1:45 — Why This Matters
**[Back to camera or GitHub page]**

> "This is what PMs and founders actually need before they waste months building the wrong thing.  
> Not a yes-man AI that nods along.  
> A Devil's Advocate that forces you to prove why you should build — backed by 300+ episodes of Lenny's Podcast."

**[Show GitHub repo or Build Club page]**

> "Built with Manus for the Lenny Challenge.  
> Open source. Open to collaborators.  
> Want your idea roasted? Send me your worst."

---

### 1:45-2:00 — End Screen
**[Show contact info]**

> "GitHub: Momo111psy/project-thirdeye  
> Twitter: @BeyondtheFrame7  
> Let's kill bad ideas before they kill your startup."

**[Fade out with Thirdeye tagline]**

> "Thirdeye sees what you're too close to see. Use it before you ship." 💀

## Recording Tips

1. **Keep it tight**: Aim for 90 seconds, max 2 minutes
2. **Show, don't tell**: Let the roast output speak for itself
3. **Highlight citations**: Zoom in on the Expert Evidence section
4. **Energy**: Match the adversarial tone — confident, slightly aggressive
5. **Call to action**: Make it clear people can try this or contribute

## What to Show On Screen

- ✅ Manus interface with skill invocation
- ✅ Full roast output (scroll through all sections)
- ✅ Citations section (pause here for emphasis)

2. Add URL to Build Club project page
3. Share on Twitter with hashtags: #LennyChallenge #ProductAI #ManusAcademy
4. Pin to GitHub README
